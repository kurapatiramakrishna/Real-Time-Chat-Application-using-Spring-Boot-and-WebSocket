        <h2>Introduction:</h2>

    <section class="section-how-it-works">
        <h2>How it Works:</h2>
       1, Connection Establishment: When you log in to <b>Chat BotðŸ’¬</b>, your device establishes a web socket connection with our server. This connection remains open as long as you are using the application.<br>

       2,Real-Time Messaging: As you type and send messages, your device sends the messages through the web socket to our server, which then broadcasts the message to all participants in the chat group. Similarly, when others send messages, you receive them through the open web socket connection.<br>

       3,Instant Updates: Web sockets allow us to update the chat window in real-time, ensuring that you see new messages as soon as they are sent by others in the group.<br>

       4, Efficiency: Unlike traditional HTTP requests, web sockets have lower overhead and reduce the latency between sending and receiving messages, making the chat experience faster and more efficient.
